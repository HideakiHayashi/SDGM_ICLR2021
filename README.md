# SDGM_ICLR2021
A Discriminative Gaussian Mixture Model with Sparsity

Official code for the paper [A Discriminative Gaussian Mixture Model with Sparsity](https://openreview.net/forum?id=-_Zp7r2-cGK) presented at ICLR2021.

Includes Matlab and Python codes. The Matlab code is an implementation of stand-alone learning based on the Laplace approximation, which is used for the benchmark classification in Section 4.1 of the paper. The Python code is for jointly training a deep neural network with the SDGM as the last layer based on dropout approximation, which is used for the image classification in Section 4.2.
